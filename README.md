# ZanJuicy
A texture replacement pack featuring Zandronum compatible shaders intended to aesthetically enhance all of the stock "liquids" found in vanilla DOOM by replacing the original flats and textures. The idea for this project was inspired by ZANLiquids while the original Super Mario: Galaxy-esque water shader and texture used are from ZanShaders.
